  "context": "Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) enhances the stability and performance of reinforcement learning in large language models by adaptively attenuating off-policy updates with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate, leading to improved training stability and performance. Reinforcement learning(RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities oflarge language models(LLMs), yet stable and performantpolicy optimizationremains challenging.Token-level importance ratiosoften exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated inMixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-basedpolicy optimizationmethods, such asGSPOandGRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We proposeSoft Adaptive Policy Optimization(SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuatesoff-policy updateswhile preserving useful learning signals. Compared withGSPOandGRPO, SAPO is bothsequence-coherentandtoken-adaptive. LikeGSPO, SAPO maintainssequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used inGSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens,GSPOsuppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improvingsample efficiency. Relative toGRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higherPass@1 performanceunder comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train theQwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization 🚀 SAPO is now live on thems-swiftmain branch!
