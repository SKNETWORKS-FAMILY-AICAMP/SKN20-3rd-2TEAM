  "context": "Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are transforming digital devices from passive tools into proactive intelligent collaborators. However, most existing frameworks remain confined to a single OS or device, making cross-device workflows brittle and largely manual. We present UFO^3, a system that unifies heterogeneous endpoints, desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge, into a single orchestration fabric. UFO^3 models each user request as a mutableTaskConstellation: a distributedDAGof atomic subtasks (TaskStars) with explicit control and data dependencies (TaskStarLines). TheTaskConstellationcontinuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. AConstellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamicDAGupdates, and theAgent Interaction Protocol(AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.\n  We evaluate UFO^3 onNebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO^3 achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposesparallelismwith an average width of 1.72, and reducesend-to-end latencyby 31% relative to a sequential baseline.Fault-injectionexperiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures. These results show that UFO^3 achieves accurate, efficient, and resilient task orchestration across heterogeneous devices, uniting isolated agents into a coherent,adaptive computing fabricthat extends across the landscape ofubiquitous computing.",
