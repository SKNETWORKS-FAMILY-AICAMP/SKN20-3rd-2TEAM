  "context": "Whilethinking-aware generationaims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existingsequential,autoregressiveapproaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we proposeParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis usingParaBenchreveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose aparallel multimodal diffusionframework,MMaDA-Parallel, that enablescontinuous,bidirectional interactionbetween text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory.MMaDA-Parallelis trained withsupervised finetuningand then further optimized byParallel Reinforcement Learning(ParaRL), a novel strategy that appliessemantic rewardsalong the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improvescross-modal alignmentandsemantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement inOutput AlignmentonParaBenchcompared to the state-of-the-art model,Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.
