  "context": "We open-source MiMo-Embodied, the firstcross-embodied foundation modelto successfully integrate and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both Autonomous Driving and Embodied AI. MiMo-Embodied sets new records across 17 embodied AI benchmarks inTask Planning,Affordance PredictionandSpatial Understanding, while also excelling in 12 autonomous driving benchmarks acrossEnvironmental Perception,Status Prediction, andDriving Planning. Across these tasks, MiMo-Embodied significantly outperforms existing open-source, closed-source, and specialized baselines. Our results indicate that throughmulti-stage learning,curated data construction, andCoT/RL fine-tuning, these two domains exhibit strongpositive transferand mutually reinforce one another. We provide a detailed analysis of our model design and training methodologies to facilitate further research. Code and models are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied.",
