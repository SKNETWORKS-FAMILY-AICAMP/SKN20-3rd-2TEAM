  "context": "This paper presents a novel approach to categorization of modern workload schedulers. We provide descriptions of three classes of schedulers: Operating Systems Process Schedulers, Cluster Systems Jobs Schedulers and Big Data Schedulers. We describe their evolution from early adoptions to modern implementations, considering both the use and features of algorithms. In summary, we discuss differences between all presented classes of schedulers and discuss their chronological development. In conclusion we highlight similarities in the focus of scheduling strategies design, applicable to both local and distributed systems.",
