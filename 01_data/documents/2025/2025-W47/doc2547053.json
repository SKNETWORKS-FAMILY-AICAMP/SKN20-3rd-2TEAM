  "context": "We present MHR, aparametric human body modelthat combines thedecoupled skeleton/shapeparadigm ofATLASwith a flexible, modern rig andpose corrective systeminspired by theMomentum library. Our model enables expressive, anatomically plausible human animation, supportingnon-linear pose correctives, and is designed for robust integration inAR/VRandgraphics pipelines.",
