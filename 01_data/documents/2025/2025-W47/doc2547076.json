  "context": "Optimizingrecommender systemsfor objectives beyond accuracy, such asdiversity,novelty, andpersonalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we termhuman priors(e.g.,item taxonomies,temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts toend-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuablehuman priorsby learninguser intentin a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding thehuman priorsaccumulated over years of practice, we introduce abackbone-agnostic frameworkthat seamlessly integrates thesehuman priorsdirectly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight,prior-conditioned adapter headsinspired byefficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangleuser intentalong human-understandable axes (e.g.,interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce ahierarchical composition strategyfor modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show thathuman priorsallow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.",
