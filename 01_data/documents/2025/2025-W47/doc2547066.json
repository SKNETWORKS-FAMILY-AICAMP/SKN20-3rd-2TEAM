  "context": "Large language models(LLMs) are powerful zero- andfew-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer fromlabel biases, and existingcalibration methodsoverlook biases arising frommulti-token class labels. We tackle an issue we calllabel length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we proposenormalized contextual calibration(NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10%F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such asmultiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined within-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples forcompetitive performance, and produces more reliableconfidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biasesto improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.",
