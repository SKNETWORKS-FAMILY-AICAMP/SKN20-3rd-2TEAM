  "context": "UV unwrappingflattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existingUV unwrappingmethods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introducePartUV, apart-based UV unwrappingpipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recentlearning-based part decompositionmethodPartField,PartUVcombines high-level semantic part decomposition with novelgeometric heuristicsin a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extendsparameterizationandpacking algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling ofnon-manifoldanddegenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes,PartUVoutperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.
