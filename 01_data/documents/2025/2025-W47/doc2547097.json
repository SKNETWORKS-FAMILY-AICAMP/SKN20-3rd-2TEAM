  "context": "We introduce Medal S, amedical segmentation foundation modelthat supports native-resolution spatial andtextual promptswithin anend-to-end trainable framework. Unlike text-only methods lacking spatial awareness, Medal S achieveschannel-wise alignmentbetweenvolumetric promptsandtext embeddings, mitigating inaccuracies from resolution mismatches. By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiplenative-resolution masksin parallel, enhancingmulti-class segmentationperformance. A lightweight3D convolutional moduleenables precisevoxel-space refinementguided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset. Medal S offers two prompting modes: atext-only mode, where model predictions serve asspatial promptsforself-refinementwithout human input, and ahybrid mode, incorporating manual annotations for enhanced flexibility. For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We proposedynamic resamplingto address target-patch ratio imbalance, extendingSATandnnU-Netfordata augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimizedtext preprocessing, atwo-stage inferencestrategy, andpost-processing techniquesto improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed. On the five-modality average on the validation set, Medal S outperformsSATwith aDSCof 75.44 (vs. 69.83),NSDof 77.34 (vs. 71.06),F1of 38.24 (vs. 24.88), andDSC TPof 65.46 (vs. 46.97). Medal S achieves excellent performance by harmonizing spatial precision with semantic textual guidance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy inmulti-class medical segmentationtasks compared to sequential prompt-based approaches. Medal S will be publicly available at https://github.com/yinghemedical/Medal-S.",
