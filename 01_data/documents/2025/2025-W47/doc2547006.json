  "context": "Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposesrecurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we proposeThink-at-Hard (TaH), adynamic latent thinkingmethod that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations,Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce aduo-causal attentionmechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enablescross-iteration information flowwhile maintaining fullsequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters fromLoRAand the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.
