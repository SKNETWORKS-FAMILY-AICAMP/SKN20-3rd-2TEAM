  "context": "We introduce Orion, a visual agent framework that can take in any modality and generate any modality. Using anagentic frameworkwith multipletool-calling capabilities, Orion is designed for visual AI tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Unlike traditional vision-language models that produce descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, includingobject detection,keypoint localization,panoptic segmentation,Optical Character Recognition, andgeometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance onMMMU,MMBench,DocVQA, andMMLongBenchwhile extending monolithic vision-language models to production-grade visual intelligence. By combiningneural perceptionwithsymbolic execution, Orion enablesautonomous visual reasoning, marking a transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.",
