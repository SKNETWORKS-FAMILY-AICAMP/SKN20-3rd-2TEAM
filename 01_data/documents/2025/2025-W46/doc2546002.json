This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.",
