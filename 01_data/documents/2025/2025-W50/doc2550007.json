  "context": "SCAIL framework improves character animation by using a novel 3D pose representation and a diffusion-transformer architecture with full-context pose injection, achieving studio-grade quality and realism. Achieving character animation that meets studio-grade production standards remains challenging despite recent progress. Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations. In this work, we present SCAIL (Studio-grade Character Animation via In-context Learning), a framework designed to address these challenges from two key innovations. First, we propose a novel3D pose representation, providing a more robust and flexible motion signal. Second, we introduce afull-context pose injectionmechanism within adiffusion-transformer architecture, enabling effectivespatio-temporal reasoningover fullmotion sequences. To align with studio-level requirements, we develop a curated data pipeline ensuring both diversity and quality, and establish a comprehensive benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that SCAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances character animation toward studio-grade reliability and realism. SCAIL is a new framework for studio-grade character animation that uses a novel 3D pose representation and full-sequence context injection to deliver more stable, realistic motion transfer under complex and cross-identity scenarios. ·Sign uporlog into comment",
