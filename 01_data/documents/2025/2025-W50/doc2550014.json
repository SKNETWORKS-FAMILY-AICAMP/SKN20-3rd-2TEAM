  "context": "A framework for self-training a Vision-Language Model (VLM) judge using self-synthesized data improves judge accuracy on VL-RewardBench, surpassing larger models in several dimensions. Effective judges ofVision-Language Models(VLMs) are crucial for model development. Current methods for trainingVLM judgesmainly rely on large-scale humanpreferenceannotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any humanpreferenceannotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diversemultimodal instruction-response pairsat varying quality levels, (2) generatereasoning tracesand judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and theirreasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge onMultimodal RewardBenchandVL-RewardBenchacross domains:correctness,preference,reasoning,safety, andvisual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy onVL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general,hallucination, andreasoningdimensions. The overall strength of these human-annotation-free results suggest the potential for a future self-judge that evolves alongside rapidly improving VLM capabilities.
