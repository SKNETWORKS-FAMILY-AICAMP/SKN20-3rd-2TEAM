  "context": "Entropy Ratio Clipping (ERC) mechanism stabilizes policy updates in reinforcement learning by addressing global distributional shifts, improving performance over existing methods. Large language model post-training relies onreinforcement learningto improve model capability and alignment quality. However, the off-policy training paradigm introducesdistribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond thetrust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations inpolicy entropyandunstable gradients. AlthoughPPO-Clipmitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using theentropy ratiobetween the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce anEntropy Ratio Clipping(ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on theentropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability ofPPO-clipto regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrateERCinto bothDAPOandGPPOreinforcement learningalgorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show thatERCconsistently improves performance.
