  "context": "A Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format) is proposed to improve the balance between accuracy and efficiency in post-training quantization of large language models by leveraging sparse and low-precision matrix multiplications. Post-training quantization(PTQ) plays a crucial role in the democratization oflarge language models(LLMs). However, existinglow-bit quantizationandsparsificationtechniques are difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency due to the limited hardware support. For example,W4A8can only achieve the same peak TOPS asW8A8whereas the GPU-supported sparse data format (2:4 semi-structure sparse) is seldomly adopted due to the loss of accuracy. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization andsparsificationpotentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs.SQ-formatmakes use of the fact thatsparse matrixcan be accelerated in high-precision, andlow-precision matrix multiplicationcan also be accelerated accordingly. As such,SQ-formatis proposed to achievePareto improvementbetweenperformanceandthroughput. This format is particularly suitable foractivationswithoutlier inequality statusand makes theirstatic compressionpossible. We show the state-of-the-art PTQperformancewithSQ-format, propose the hardware required to support it, and further offer the design exploration and insights for the next-generationAI accelerators.
