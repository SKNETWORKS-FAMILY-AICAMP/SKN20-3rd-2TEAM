  "context": "SpaceControl enables explicit spatial control of 3D generation using various geometric inputs, outperforming existing methods in geometric faithfulness while maintaining visual quality. Generative methodsfor3D assetshave recently achieved remarkable progress, yet providing intuitive and precise control over the object geometry remains a key challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text orimage prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduceSpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range ofgeometric inputs, from coarseprimitivesto detailedmeshes, and integrates seamlessly with modernpre-trained generative modelswithout requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off betweengeometric fidelityand output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate thatSpaceControloutperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving highvisual quality. Finally, we present aninteractive user interfacethat enables online editing ofsuperquadricsfor direct conversion into textured3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.
