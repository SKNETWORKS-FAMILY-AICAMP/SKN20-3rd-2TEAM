  "context": "ChronosObserver generates high-fidelity, 3D-consistent, and time-synchronized multi-view videos using a training-free approach that leverages World State Hyperspace and Hyperspace Guided Sampling. Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of3D-consistentand high-fidelitytime-synchronizedmulti-view videosremains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method includingWorld State Hyperspaceto represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, andHyperspace Guided Samplingto synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and3D-consistenttime-synchronizedmulti-view videosgeneration without training or fine-tuning fordiffusion models.
