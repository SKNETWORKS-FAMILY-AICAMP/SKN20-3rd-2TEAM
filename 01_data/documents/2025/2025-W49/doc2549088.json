  "context": "The proposed Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT) algorithm improves diffusion models at test-time by leveraging flow maps to better align with user-specified rewards, enabling more effective sampling and image editing. A common recipe to improvediffusion modelsat test-time so that samples score highly against a user-specified reward is to introduce thegradient of the rewardinto the dynamics of the diffusion itself. This procedure is often ill posed, as user-specified rewards are usually only well defined on the data distribution at the end of generation. While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with aflow map. By exploiting a relationship between theflow mapandvelocity fieldgoverning the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm,Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving thegradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling viaimportance weightingor principled search that identifies local maximizers of thereward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how theflow mapenables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing withvision language models. TL;DR: We introduce Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which uses a flow-map look-ahead to apply rewards throughout generative diffusion trajectories, enabling more effective test-time optimization than denoiser-based guidance and achieving better sampling/search under complex rewards (including VLM-based ones).
