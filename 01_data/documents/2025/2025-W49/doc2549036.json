  "context": "The ViDiC task and ViDiC-1K dataset evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models' ability to describe differences between video pairs, addressing limitations in capturing motion continuity and event evolution. Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work onImage Difference Captioning(IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce theViDiC(Video Difference Captioning) task and its correspondingViDiC-1Kdataset, designed to evaluate the ability ofMultimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs.ViDiC-1Kcomprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparativechecklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose adual-checklist frameworkthat measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on theLLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hopeViDiC-1Kcan be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancingvideo understanding,edit awareness, andcomparative reasoningin multimodal intelligence.
