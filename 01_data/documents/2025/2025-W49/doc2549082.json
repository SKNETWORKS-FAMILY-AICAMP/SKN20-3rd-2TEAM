  "context": "VideoScience-Bench evaluates video models' scientific reasoning by assessing their ability to generate phenomena consistent with undergraduate-level physics and chemistry concepts. The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable ofzero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models'scientific reasoningcapability. We introduceVideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiplescientific conceptsto generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curatedpromptsspanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models inT2VandI2Vsettings along five dimensions:Prompt Consistency,Phenomenon Congruency,Correct Dynamism,Immutability, andSpatio-Temporal Continuity. Using aVLM-as-a-Judgeto assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge,VideoScience-Benchis the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.
