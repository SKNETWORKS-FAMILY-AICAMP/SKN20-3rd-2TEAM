  "context": "A track-conditioned video-to-video framework enables precise joint editing of camera and object motion using 3D point tracks to maintain spatiotemporal coherence and handle occlusions. Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Currentmotion-controlled image-to-video (I2V)approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, whilevideo-to-video (V2V)methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired3D point tracksrepresenting source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preservingspatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolvedepth orderand handleocclusionsfor precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, includingjoint camera/object manipulation,motion transfer, andnon-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.
