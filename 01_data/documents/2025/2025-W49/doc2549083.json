  "context": "CookAnything is a diffusion-based framework that generates coherent image sequences from cooking instructions by incorporating step-wise regional control, flexible positional encoding, and cross-step consistency. Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recentdiffusion modelshave shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios likerecipe illustration. Additionally, currentrecipe illustrationmethods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1)Step-wise Regional Control(SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a singledenoising process; (2)Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances bothtemporal coherenceandspatial diversity; and (3)Cross-Step Consistency Control(CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results onrecipe illustrationbenchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation. ·Sign uporlog into comment",
