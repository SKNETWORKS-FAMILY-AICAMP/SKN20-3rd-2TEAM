  "context": "CodeVision, a flexible code-as-tool framework, enhances multimodal large language models' robustness and tool-based reasoning by generating code to handle image operations, overcoming brittleness and improving performance through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-artMLLMsare surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we proposeCodeVision, a flexible and scalablecode-as-tool frameworkwhere the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning withSupervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turntool compositionanderror recovery, followed byReinforcement Learning(RL) with a novel and denseprocess reward functionto encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments onQwen2.5-VLandQwen3-VLseries show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexibletool composition, efficient chained execution, and robusterror recoveryfrom runtime feedback.
