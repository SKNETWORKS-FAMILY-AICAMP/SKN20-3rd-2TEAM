Diffusion modelshave achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavycomputational costand the need for numerousinference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-stepdistillationattempt to skip redundant steps by trainingcompact student models, yet they often suffer from heavyretraining costsand degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate thisphase-aware strategywith two experts that specialize inslow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model withlightweight LoRA adaptersachieves both efficientaccelerationand strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters asSlow-LoRAandFast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5accelerationover the base model while maintaining comparablevisual qualityacross diversebenchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1sampleson a singleV100within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly onunseen prompts.  ·Sign uporlog into comment",
