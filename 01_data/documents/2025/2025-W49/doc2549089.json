  "context": "RS-EoT, a language-driven iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm, addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing tasks by using a self-play multi-agent system and a two-stage RL strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RS VQA benchmarks. Recentmultimodal reasoningmodels, inspired byDeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, inremote sensing(RS) tasks, we observe widespreadpseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to theGlance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we proposeRS-EoT(Remote SensingEvidence-of-Thought), alanguage-driven,iterative visual evidence-seekingparadigm. To instill this paradigm, we proposeSocraticAgent, aself-play multi-agentsystem that synthesizesreasoning tracesvia alternating cycles of reasoning andvisual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stageprogressive RLstrategy: first, RL on fine-grainedGrounding tasksto enhanceRS-EoTcapabilities, followed by RL onRS VQAto generalize to broader understanding scenarios.
