  "context": "A multimodal translation system, OmniFusion, integrates pretrained multimodal foundation models and translation LLMs for simultaneous speech translation and improved translation quality by leveraging audio and visual inputs. There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrainedmultimodal foundation models(MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicatedtranslation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose anend-to-end approachthat fusesMMFMswithtranslation LLMs. We introduce a novelfusion strategythat connectshidden statesfrom multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enablingjoint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can performspeech-to-text,speech-and-image-to-text, andtext-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction inSimulSTcompared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation qualityCode is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion.
