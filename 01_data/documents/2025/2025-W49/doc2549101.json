Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)show promising results as decision-making engines forembodied agentsoperating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodiedphysical interactionunderexplored. To address this gap, we introduceCFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability.CFG-Benchconsists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562three-modalitiesquestion-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1)Physical Interaction, 2)Temporal-Causal Relation, 3)Intentional Understanding, and 4)Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation onCFG-Benchreveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions forphysical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover,supervised fine-tuning (SFT)on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on establishedembodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and groundedembodied agents.
