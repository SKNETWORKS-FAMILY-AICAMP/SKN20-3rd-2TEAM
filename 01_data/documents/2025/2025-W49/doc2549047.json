  "context": "DualCamCtrl is a diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation that uses a dual-branch framework and Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment to improve consistency and disentangle appearance and geometry modeling. This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-enddiffusion modelforcamera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses asray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing adual-branch frameworkthat mutually generates camera-consistentRGBanddepth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose theSemantic Guided Mutual Alignment(SIGMA) mechanism, which performsRGB-depth fusionin a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangleappearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses acrossdenoising stagesand further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistentcamera-controlled video generation, with over 40\\% reduction incamera motion errorscompared with prior methods.
