  "context": "ImageCritic addresses image generation inconsistencies using reference-guided post-editing with attention alignment loss and a detail encoder, improving fine-grained detail accuracy. Previous works have explored various customized generation tasks given a reference image, but they still face limitations in generating consistent fine-grained details. In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained viaVLM-based selectionand explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model'sattention mechanismsand intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise anattention alignment lossand adetail encoderto precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round andlocal editingin complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.
