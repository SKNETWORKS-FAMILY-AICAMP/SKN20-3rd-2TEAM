  "context": "YOLOv5 algorithms enhance thyroid nodule segmentation accuracy in ultrasound images, particularly when incorporating doppler images, offering a real-time solution for clinical diagnostics. The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation ofthyroid nodulesis a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses oninstance segmentationofthyroid nodulesusingYOLOv5algorithms onultrasound images. We evaluated multipleYOLOv5variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and withoutdoppler images. TheYOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with adice scoreof 91\\% andmAPof 0.87 on the dataset includingdoppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate thatdoppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. TheYOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\\%dice scorewhendoppler imageswere excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest thatinstance segmentationwithYOLOv5provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications inautomated diagnostic systems.
