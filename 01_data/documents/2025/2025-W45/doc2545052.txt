A benchmark and framework improve Vision-Language Models' performance on Rebus Puzzles through structured reasoning and example selection.
Understanding Rebus Puzzles (Rebus Puzzles use pictures, symbols, and letters to represent words or phrases creatively) requires a variety of skills such as image recognition, cognitive skills, commonsense reasoning, multi-step reasoning, image-based wordplay, etc., making this a challenging task for even current Vision-Language Models. In this paper, we present left|,circlearrowright,text{BUS},right|, a large and diverse benchmark of 1,333 English Rebus Puzzles containing different artistic styles and levels of difficulty, spread across 18 categories such as food, idioms, sports, finance, entertainment, etc. We also propose RebusDescProgICE, a model-agnostic framework which uses a combination of an unstructured description and code-based, structured reasoning, along with better, reasoning-based in-context example selection, improving the performance of Vision-Language Models on left|,circlearrowright,text{BUS},right| by 2.1-4.1% and 20-30% using closed-source and open-source models respectively compared to Chain-of-Thought Reasoning.
