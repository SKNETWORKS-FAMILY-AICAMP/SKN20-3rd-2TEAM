  "context": "EVTAR is an end-to-end virtual try-on model that enhances accuracy by using reference images, simplifying the inference process and improving garment texture and detail preservation.\nWe propose EVTAR, an End-to-End Virtual Try-on model with Additional Reference, that directly fits the target garment onto the person image while incorporating reference images to enhance try-on accuracy. Most existing virtual try-on approaches rely on complex inputs such as agnostic person images, human pose, densepose, or body keypoints, making them labor-intensive and impractical for real-world applications. In contrast, EVTAR adopts a two-stage training strategy, enabling simple inference with only the source image and the target garment inputs. Our model generates try-on results without masks, densepose, or segmentation maps. Moreover, EVTAR leverages additional reference images of different individuals wearing the same clothes to preserve garment texture and fine-grained details better. This mechanism is analogous to how humans consider reference models when choosing outfits, thereby simulating a more realistic and high-quality dressing effect. We enrich the training data with supplementary references and unpaired person images to support these capabilities. We evaluate EVTAR on two widely used benchmarks and diverse tasks, and the results consistently validate the effectiveness of our approach.",
