    "context": "GEM, an open-source environment simulator, facilitates experience-based learning for large language models by providing a standardized framework and diverse environments for training and benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms. The training paradigm forlarge language models(LLMs) is moving from static\ndatasets toexperience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via\ninteracting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we\nintroduceGEM(General Experience Maker), an open-sourceenvironment simulatordesigned for the age of LLMs. Analogous toOpenAI-Gymfor traditionalreinforcement learning (RL),GEMprovides a standardized framework for the\nenvironment-agent interface, includingasynchronous vectorized executionfor\nhigh throughput, andflexible wrappersfor easy extensibility.GEMalso\nfeatures a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and\nsingle-file example scripts demonstrating usingGEMwith five popular RL\ntraining frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across\n24 environments usingREINFORCEwithReturn Batch Normalization(ReBN), which\n-- unlikeGRPO-- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn\nrewards and offers better credit assignment.
