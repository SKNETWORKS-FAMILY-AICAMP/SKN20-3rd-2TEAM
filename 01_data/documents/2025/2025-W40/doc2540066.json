  "context": "Toucan, a large publicly available tool-agentic dataset, enhances the performance of LLM agents by providing diverse, realistic, and complex multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. Large Language Model (LLM)agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems\nfor automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community\nis constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic\ntraining data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and\ncomplexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To\naddress this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available\ntool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized\nfrom nearly 500 real-worldModel Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,\nToucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and\nchallenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline\nfirst produces a broad spectrum oftool-use queriesusing five distinct models,\nappliesmodel-based quality filtering, and then generatesagentic trajectorieswith threeteacher modelsusing twoagentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and\nmodel-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three\nextension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn\nconversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source\ncounterparts on theBFCL V3 benchmarkand push the Pareto frontier forward onMCP-Universe Bench.
