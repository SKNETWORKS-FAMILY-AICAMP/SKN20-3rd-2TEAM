Large language models(LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities\nas autonomous agents, showing promise inreasoning,tool use, and sequential\ndecision-making.

To address this gap, we introduce\nStockBench, acontamination-free benchmarkdesigned to evaluateLLM agentsin\nrealistic, multi-month stock trading environments.

Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g.,GPT-5,Claude-4) and\nopen-weight (e.g.,Qwen3,Kimi-K2,GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM\nagents struggle to outperform the simplebuy-and-hold baseline, several models\ndemonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more\neffectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in\ndeveloping LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static\nfinancial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successfultrading strategies.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively.
