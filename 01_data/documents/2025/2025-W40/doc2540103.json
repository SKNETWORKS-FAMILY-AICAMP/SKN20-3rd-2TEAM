    "context": "A unified Regression Language Model (RLM) predicts numeric outcomes of code executions, including memory footprint, latency, and neural network performance, across multiple languages and hardware platforms. We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code\nexecutions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming\nlanguages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific\nfeature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model\n(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint\nof code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the\nlatency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained\nneural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M\nparameter RLM initialized fromT5Gemma, obtains > 0.9Spearman-rankon\ncompetitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model\nachieves > 0.5 averageSpearman-rankacross 17 separate languages from CodeNet.\nFurthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest averageKendall-Tauof 0.46 on five\nclassicNAS design spacespreviously dominated bygraph neural networks, and\nsimultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.
