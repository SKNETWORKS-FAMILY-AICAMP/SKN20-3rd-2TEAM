    "context": "ToG-3, a novel framework, enhances LLMs with external knowledge using a dynamic, multi-agent system that evolves queries and subgraphs for precise evidence retrieval and reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) andGraph-based RAGhas become the\nimportant paradigm for enhancingLarge Language Models(LLMs) with external\nknowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introducesMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval(MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\naChunk-Triplets-Communityheterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism ofEvolving Queryand Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of priorGraph-based RAGmethods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. Amulti-agent system, comprisingConstructor,Retriever,Reflector, andResponseragents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially,evolving queryand\nsubgraph. This dual-evolvingmulti-agent systemallows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep andbroad reasoningbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.
