We introduce Aristotle, an AI system that combinesformal verificationwithinformal reasoning, achieving gold-medal-equivalent performance on the 2025\nInternational Mathematical Olympiad problems. Aristotle integrates three main\ncomponents: aLean proof searchsystem, aninformal reasoningsystem that\ngenerates and formalizeslemmas, and a dedicatedgeometry solver. Our system\ndemonstrates state-of-the-art performance with favorable scaling properties forautomated theorem proving.
