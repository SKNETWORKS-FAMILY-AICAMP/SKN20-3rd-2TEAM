  "context": "Vision-Zero is a domain-agnostic framework that enhances vision-language models through self-improvement in competitive visual games, using Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization and achieving state-of-the-art performance without human annotation. Althoughreinforcement learning(RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning\ncapabilities ofvision-language models(VLMs), current methods remain heavily\ndependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual\nconstruction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and\nconsequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM\nself-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary\nimage pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the\nSpy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions\nacross multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously\ngenerate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from\nArbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate\ngames from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability\nacross diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We\ndemonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:\nCLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable\nPerformance Gain: We introduceIterative Self-Play Policy Optimization(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates betweenSelf-Playandreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards(RLVR), mitigating the\nperformance plateau often seen inself-play-only training and achieving\nsustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,\nand vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based\nmethods.
