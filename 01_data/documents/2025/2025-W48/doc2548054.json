  "context": "We present ReDirector, a novel camera-controlled video retake generation method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse of RoPE in previous works by aligning the spatiotemporal positions of the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding ( RoCE ), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE , our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation . Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability , geometric consistency , and video quality across various trajectories and lengths.",
