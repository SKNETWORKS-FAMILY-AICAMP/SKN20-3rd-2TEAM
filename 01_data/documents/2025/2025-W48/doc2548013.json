  "context": "Computer-Use Agents ( CUA ) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces ( GUI ). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models ( Coder ) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym , a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models , we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability , we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder - CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate . To turn CUA feedback into usable gui dance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable gui dance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.",
