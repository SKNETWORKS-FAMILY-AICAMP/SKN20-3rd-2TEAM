  "context": "Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning , we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning . Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair , enabling the model to introspect , verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis . It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning , and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle , where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.
