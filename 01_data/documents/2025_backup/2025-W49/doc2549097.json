  "context": "Ovis-Image is a 7B text-to-image model optimized for high-quality text rendering under computational constraints, combining a diffusion-based visual decoder with a multimodal backbone and a text-centric training pipeline. We introduce Ovis-Image, a 7Btext-to-image modelspecifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates adiffusion-based visual decoderwith the stronger Ovis 2.5multimodal backbone, leveraging atext-centric training pipelinethat combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such asQwen-Imageand approaches closed-source systems likeSeedreamandGPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strongmultimodal backbonewith a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliablebilingual text renderingwithout resorting to oversized or proprietary models. Built upon Ovis-U1, Ovis-Image is a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints.
