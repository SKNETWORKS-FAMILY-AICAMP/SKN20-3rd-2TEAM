  "context": "PretrainZero is a reinforcement active learning framework that enhances general reasoning capabilities by pretraining large models on a corpus without verifiable labels, improving performance on benchmarks compared to domain-specific training. Mimicking human behavior to actively learning from general experience and achieve artificial general intelligence has always been a human dream. Recentreinforcement learning(RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcementactive learningframework built on the pretraining corpus to extendRLfrom domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1)Active pretraining: inspired by theactive learningability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents byRL. 2)Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels,pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus usingRL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improvesQwen3-4B-Basefor 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 onMMLU-Pro,SuperGPQAandmath average benchmarks. In post-training, the pretrained models can also serve as reasoning foundation models for downstreamRLVR tasks.
