  "context": "PaperDebugger is an in-editor academic writing assistant that integrates large language models, enabling direct interaction within LaTeX editors for document state management, revision, and literature search. Large language modelsare increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly withinLaTeX editorssuch asOverleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor,multi-agent, andplugin-basedacademic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling suchin-editor interactionis technically non-trivial: it requires reliablebidirectional synchronizationwith the editor, fine-grainedversion controlandpatching,secure state management,multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and aModel Context Protocol(MCP) toolchain that integratesliterature search,reference lookup,document scoring, andrevision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, includinglocalized edits,structured reviews,parallel agent execution, anddiff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.
